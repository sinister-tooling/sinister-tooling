- 👋 Hi, I’m @sinister-tooling
- 👀 I'm working as penetration tester and developing basic tooling to automate parts of my job, mostly in python (I do not have a background in coding, I have mostly worked in techsupport/infrastructure management etc).
- 🌱 Everyday is a learning day.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything?
- 📫 Reach me through github.
